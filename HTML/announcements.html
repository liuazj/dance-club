                <p> We hope everyone’s had an awesome Christmas break! While we’re just as sad about going back to school as you are, we’re here to make things better ;) Our first week back, Dance Club will be holding some super fun and chill activities to help us get back in the swing of things.
                  <p> Monday, January 7 (Day 4), we will be having our Dance Challenge day! We have an awesome set list ready for us to try out some 2x speed dances and a RANDOM PLAY DANCE (with your favourite kpop + pop songs ^.^) </h2>
                  <p> Wednesday, January 9 (Day 2) will be photo day! Make sure to bring/wear your outfits from the Christmas performance  so we can take photos for each of our performance groups.
                  <p> As usual, Dance Club will be held in Gym C at lunch. Following next week, we will be going back to teaching some new choreography for you guys!
                  <p> If you’ve been following on Instagram @cb.dance, you’ll know that we will be starting with K/DA POP/STARS and NCT 127 - Simon Says. More details to come!

If you guys have been paying attention to our Instagram, you'll know that we are in the process of editing and uploading videos of each of our dances as well as a full performance video to give you guys. But, in the meantime, here's a link to the raw video footage from our performance! It is currently unlisted on Youtube, meaning only those with the link have access.
